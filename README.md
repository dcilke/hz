# hz

Human readable streaming formatter based on `zerolog.ConsoleWriter{}`

## Install

### Go

```zsh
go get github.com/dcilke/hz
```

### Homebrew

```zsh
brew tap dcilke/taps
brew install dcilke/taps/hz
```

## Why?

I use [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) for structured logging and want to be able to quickly tap into the log streams.
